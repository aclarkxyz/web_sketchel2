# SketchEl2

*SketchEl 2* is a drawing program for chemical structures, based on the [WebMolKit](https://github.com/aclarkxyz/web_molkit) toolkit.
It is written in _TypeScript_, cross-compiled to _JavaScript_, and made available on desktop platforms using _Electron_.

*SketchEl 2* is the successor to the original [SketchEl](http://sketchel.sf.net) application, which was written in _Java_, using
the Swing toolkit, and provided an applet-based web plugin (which is now obsolete).

As of June 2017, the project is very early: there is no guarantee that it is fit for any purpose, but you are welcome to try it out,
provide feedback and/or submit patches.
